The goal of this thesis is to calculate the required filter bandwidths of the Comet Camera (CoCa) on the Comet Interceptor mission. Reflectance of the Comet as well as the exposure time need to be taken into account.

The solar spectrum, transmission spectrum of the mirrors, quantum efficiency are placed in the /data folder.
